## How to Install

```
pip install colorama

git clone https://github.com/Michael-Sebero/Genetic-Trait-Detector

python3 /path/to/genetic-trait-detector.py
```

## Description

Genetic-Trait-Detector detects traits in your genes when provided DNA data which is formatted in rsID format. Once the traits are matched with genes from your DNA you'll be given a result which tells you what traits your genes are associated with. Read the disclaimer for more information reguarding results.

The intention of this software is to provide a FOSS alternative to detecting genetic traits. Databreaches occur often and institutions shouldn't be trusted with processing / storing client genetic data over a long period of time. Genetic-Trait-Detector is completely private and can be ran offline without sending PIA to a website.

## This script detects genetic traits associated with

```
Bipolar Disorder, Alzheimer's, Autism, Schizophrenia, Longevity, Immunity, Intelligence, Muscular Performance, OCD, Metabolism, Eyes and Hair
```

## How to use Genetic-Trait-Detector

- Aquire a copy of your DNA data from a genetic testing platform.
- Open up the DNA file and make sure it's formatted in rsID format.

> The script looks for the rsid and genotype to determine results.

    rsid            chromosome     position    allele1	allele2
 
    rs5030953       1              35675       T            T

- Input the raw DNA file pathway into the console.

## DISCLAIMER

This software is not meant to diagnose any disorders or diseases. SNP data in this script is sourced from https://www.snpedia.com/ which publish genetic datasets. The process of diagnosis is complex and requires additional steps to confirm.
