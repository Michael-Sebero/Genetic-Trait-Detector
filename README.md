## Description
Genetic-Trait-Detector detects traits in your genes when provided DNA data which is formatted in rsID format. Once the traits are matched with genes from your DNA you'll be given a result which tells you what traits your genes are associated with. Read the disclaimer for more information reguarding results.

The intention of this software is to provide a FOSS alternative to detecting genetic traits. Databreaches occur often and institutions shouldn't be trusted with processing / storing genetic data over a long period of time. Genetic-Trait-Detector is completely private and can be ran offline without sending PIA to a website.

## This script detects genetic traits associated with 
```
Bipolar Disorder, Alzheimer's, Autism, Schizophrenia, Longevity, Immunity, Intelligence, Muscular Performance and OCD 
```
## How to use Genetic-Trait-Detector

. Aquire a copy of your DNA data from a genetic testing platform.

. Open up the DNA file and make sure it's formatted in in rsID format. 
> The script looks for the rsid and genotype to determine results.

    rsid      chromosome     position    allele1	allele2
